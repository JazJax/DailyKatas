# DailyKatas
I need to do more katas... so I thought I'd set up a central repo for them all. The idea is to use TDD all the way, unless I have an interesting reason to do something else!

## Contents
- Running different languages/frameworks:
  - [Kotlin](docs/RunningKotlinApps.md)
- [System dependencies](docs/SystemDependencies.md)
- [Kata sources](#kata-sources)
- [Repo structure](#repo-structure)

## Kata sources
- https://codingdojo.org/practices/KataCatalogue/

## Repo structure
Katas first! Language second! Date/iteration third!
