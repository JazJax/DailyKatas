# DailyKatas
I need to do more katas... so I thought I'd set up a central repo for them all.

Kata sources:
- https://codingdojo.org/practices/KataCatalogue/
- https://learn.madetech.com/technology/katas/

## General rules
- TDD!

## Repo structure
Katas first! Language second! Date/iteration third!
